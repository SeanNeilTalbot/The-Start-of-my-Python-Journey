# The-Start-of-my-Python-Journey
My journey through learning and developing skills in python.

Basically, this section is a start to a basic portfolio ofmy own written code, most of which are basic and common code practices.

The aim of this section is document my journey and hold myself accountable to my progression.

I am starting this new jounrey using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

1. HelloWord.py - The first code was the traditional first code of HelloWorld.

2. PrintNurseryRhyme.py - Basic code on different print methods and practice the prin() method.

3. DisplayingText.py - More text displaying coding examples

4. PrintPoem.py - Printing a poem over multiple lines.

5. StringsAndVariables.py - Requesting input, assigning input to variables and manipulating.

6. StoryTeller.py - Story teller program showing examples of input, output, variable manipulation and formatting.

7. MathOperations.py - Most common math operations in Python and the use of them. We also take a look at formatting

8. DateTime.py - We take a look at date and time as well as importing modules

#Remember; 
There is always more than one way to do something, as long as it works!
Always test your code!
