# The-Start-of-my-Python-Journey
My journey through learning and developing skills in python.

Basically, this section is a start to a basic portfolio ofmy own written code, most of which are basic and common code practices.

The aim of this section is document my journey and hold myself accountable to my progression.

I am starting this new jounrey using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

Chapter 1 - Introduction to the Basics

1.1. HelloWord.py - The first code was the traditional first code of HelloWorld.
